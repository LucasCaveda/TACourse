Having lived in Madrid for almost two years,
I have been struck by the extent of single-use
and disposable plastic, styrofoam and polystyrene.
Plastic reigns supreme, it is everywhere. Worringly,
there often appears to be a carefree attitude toward
the damage plastic and other trash has on the environment,
the city’s streets and surrounding countryside. Let me
be clear I am from London, which, like much of the
world, has a great deal of plastic pollution and waste.
My observations, questions and potential solutions are
not judgments or a sense of moral superiority. This is
about the world’s addiction to plastic and how it
manifests in Madrid.
